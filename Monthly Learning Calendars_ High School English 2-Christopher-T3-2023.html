                          A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night.

                          Capulet. Young Romeo is it?
                          Tybalt. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

                          Capulet. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
                          He bears him like a portly gentleman;
                          And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
                          To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
                          I would not for the wealth of all the town
                          Here in my house do him disparagement:
                          Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
                          It is my will, the which if thou respect,
                          Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
                          And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

                          Tybalt. It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
                          I'll not endure him.”(1.5.684-699)

                      Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

                      Benvolio. I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
                      Or manage it to part these men with me.

                      Tybalt. What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
                      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
                      Have at thee, coward!
                      [They fight]
                      [Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
                      then enter Citizens, with clubs]

                      First Citizen. Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!”

                      In this piece, Tybalt is trying to aggravate someone into fighting him, and succeeding in doing such. 
                      This action that Tybalt created showed how anger when it consumes a person, tries to unleash other into doing that task

                       In this piece, the hatred that the Capulets have for Juliet is them rejecting her.
